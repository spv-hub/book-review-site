      <h2>Book Description</h2>
      <p>
        For many programmers, discovering Ruby is a revelation. They are overjoyed by how elegantly and succinctly they can 
        state problems in the language. But then the real world creeps in, and that joy gradually wanes as the code becomes 
        cluttered with distracting edge case scenarios, error handling, and checks for nil.Confident 
        Ruby is a guide to recapturing the joy of writing Ruby by employing small patterns and stylistic choices 
        to make each method tell a coherent story. Over the course of 32 patterns, you’ll learn how to isolate uncertainty 
        at the borders of your code; how to avoid repetitive conditionals; and how to liberate your code from the chore of nil-checking. 
        You’ll discover the four parts of a method, and how to use those parts to construct a narrative. Following along with real-world
        refactoring sessions, you’ll learn how to apply these lessons to legacy code.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Whether you are a novice or an experienced Ruby hacker, this book will help you become a more confident and joyful programmer.

        <h3><em>"This is hands down one of the best short, practical books on Ruby I have ever seen"</em></h3>

          t's full of advice and insights that you can put to use right away, and Avdi puts things together in surprising ways sometimes. 
          His "Exceptional Ruby" is another essential book, even though there's some overlap here. His approach to problems is unique, 
          interesting, and thought-provoking, and I wish I had a print version of this book to keep on my desk for reference
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm really glad I joined a second technical book club to read this book. The writing is very clear, the examples are
          generally not too difficult to understand, and there are rationales for when you would want to use these patterns that 
          will help make those judgment calls. Also, the patterns are at a good level of detail--not too large where you might feel 
          like, well I can't redesign all the objects in this legacy system I work with 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Rubyist you probably already know Avdi Grimm and have read something by him, be it a book or some blog posts. 
          What I particularly like about his writing is that while tackle all the common pitfalls in everyday software development, 
          he generally doesn't offer one-size-fits-all solutions, but is willing to explore a range of possible alternatives.
