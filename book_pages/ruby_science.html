      <h2>Book Description</h2>
      <p>The reference for writing fantastic Rails applications</p>
      <p>
        You build web applications, and you love Ruby on Rails because it
        provides a framework for developing applications that are are fast, fun,
        and easy to change. Over time these applications can become bloated,
        development slows down, and changes to the codebase become painful.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book was written to help you learn to detect emerging problems in
        your codebase; we'll deliver the solutions for fixing them, and
        maintaining an application that will be fun to work on for years to
        come.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the book (in HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Kindle formats), you
        also get a complete example application, and the ability to get your
        questions about Ruby on Rails answered by the thoughtbot team.

            Review by Moski Doski <br />

          <br />
          Wow. What a great book for any rails developer, specially if you are
          constantly refactoring code in ruby
        </p>
        <p>
          The authors behind well known ruby gems as paperclip, voltage,
          shoulda, factorygirl, etc. made a great work in writing this book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first part describes many of the most common code smells in ruby,
          as duplicated code, large class, large method, shotgun surgery, etc,
          with a brief way on how to approach these.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part details the solutions started on the first part:
          Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, replace conditional with null
          object, extract value object, extract validator. etc
        </p>
        <p>
          I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone except those who, well,
          could have written a similar book themselves. The short punchy
          chapters make it a delight to read and gives the option of reading it
          merely 10 minutes at a time before bed or similar. The short chapters
          also make it useful as a reference if you forget how to do a certain
          thing like, say, use method_missing, even though it's not put together
          as a reference book at all. Lastly, this book is a must read if you're
          not confident with Ruby idioms and the best way to structure and lay
          out your code - Russ's approaches reinforce the current "standard" way
          to write Ruby and this alone is worth the price of admission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third party describes the most important principles when
          developing in ruby/rails. Law Of Demeter, DRY, Composition over
          inheritance, Open/Closed are always perfectly summarised.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole book is of course full of examples illustrating each of the
          chapters.
        </p>
        <p>A must read.</p>
