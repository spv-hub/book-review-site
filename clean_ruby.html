        Writing small and easily testable methods can certainly clean things up,
        but as your application grows your classes start to know too much. Large
        classes means a large cognitive overhead for understanding how things
        work, or why they donâ€™t. It would be great to keep related things closer
        together. If this needs that to function, why aren't they right in front
        of your face? You might have broken things up well, but each time you
        search around for related code it begins to feel like a mess. Ham hock

          Jim offers some pretty powerful ideas about forwarding and delegation
          using ruby. I came away knowing more than I when I started the book. A
          comprehensive example of how the ideas could improve a business
          problem would help them stick. Kevin jowl swine biltong pork loin

          Olsen, with his latest effort has mastered the art of writing a book
          that is extremely interesting, fun, and informative. As an author
          myself, I greatly admire the ability in other authors to take what
          many would consider dry and bland, a programming language book, and
          create something that is truly special. Let me not give the impression
          that "Eloquent Ruby" is filled with fluff however; on the contrary, of
          any Ruby book that I've read I have learn the most from Mr. Olsen's
          masterpiece.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Eloquent Ruby" is written for the programmer like me: someone with
          previous programming experience, but with only a passing understanding
          of Ruby itself. The structure of the book will help guide the Ruby
          neophyte toward a stronger understanding of not only the language
          constructs and idioms, but also the Ruby culture. As an outsider to
          said culture, I've always viewed the Ruby community as merely a
          collection of characters, but Olsen's book helps to illustrate that
          (almost universally) Ruby practitioners first and foremost strive to
          create correct and robust solutions. As a proponent of the Lisp family
          of languages, I tend to look askance at languages falling into the
          ALGOL family, but "Eloquent Ruby" has succeeded in convincing me that
          with the right approach and mindset then Ruby can be a stunningly
          beautiful language. And this is really the key point to take away from
          Mr. Olsen's book. That is, he guides the reader through the Ruby
          mindset to drive home the point that Ruby's features -- from its
          powerful and fluent blocks and modules, to the mind-bending
          metaprogramming facilities, to its to its humble symbol, and through
          its philosophy of "Objects all the way down" -- play together in such
          a way as to foster ... well, elegance.
